# Pouchnotes

A simple, offline-first notes app. Intended as a demo application for [CouchDB Minihosting](https://github.com/neighbourhoodie/couchdb-minihosting).


Pouchnotes allows you to take notes on multiple devices, online or offline, and they will all be synced with each other in real time through a central CouchDB.

The app uses Vite + Svelte 5 + Pico.css + PouchDB.

For simplicity, it does _not_ store a session, so youâ€™ll have to log in every time you reload.

## Setup

Pouchnotes is intended to be deployed on a CouchDB Minihosting instance via the deployment method provided by that repo. After youâ€™ve set up your CouchDB Minihosting, follow the [deployment instructions](https://github.com/neighbourhoodie/couchdb-minihosting/tree/main/deployment).

To build Pouchnotes:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    $ npm i
    ```
2. Update the `.env.production` file with your CouchDB Minihosting endpoint URL, eg. 
    ```
    VITE_LOCAL_COUCHDB_ENDPOINT=https://backend.lol/_api
    ```
3. Build and deploy:
    ```sh
    $ npm run build && ./deploy.sh
    ```

Before you can use the app, you need to set up a user and a target DB in your CouchDB. Weâ€™re going do this with cURL. In all of these commands, replace `COUCHDB_USERNAME` and `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` with the admin credentials to your CouchDB, and the `COUCHDB_ENDPOINT` with your CouchDB Minihosting endpoint, same as in the `.env.production` file above.

Replace _all_ instances of `YOUR_USERNAME` in all commands with the username youâ€™d like to log into Pouchnotes with (the first command has two!). 

1. **Add a user**
   
   Because weâ€™re going to be using the username as part of a database name in a second, make sure it conforms to these rules: only lowercase characters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and any of the characters `_ $ ( ) + -` and `/` are allowed. Must begin with a letter.

   You might also want to change the password ðŸ˜…

    ```sh 
    curl  -X PUT \
    'COUCHDB_ENDPOINT/_users/org.couchdb.user:YOUR_USERNAME' \
    --user COUCHDB_USERNAME:COUCHDB_PASSWORD \
    --data-raw '{
      "password": "12341234",
      "roles": [
        "users"
      ],
      "name": "YOUR_USERNAME",
      "type": "user"
    }'
    ```
2. **Add a database**
   
   Call it `pouchnotes-${your-username-from-step-1}`, eg. `pouchnotes-fenella`:

    ```sh
    curl  -X PUT \
    'COUCHDB_ENDPOINT/pouchnotes-YOUR_USERNAME' \
    --user COUCHDB_USERNAME:COUCHDB_PASSWORD
    ```

3. **Give your user permission to access that database**:

    ```sh
    curl  -X PUT \
    'COUCHDB_ENDPOINT/pouchnotes-YOUR_USERNAME/_security' \
    --user COUCHDB_USERNAME:COUCHDB_PASSWORD \
    --data-raw '{
      "members": {
        "names": [
          "YOUR_USERNAME"
        ]
      }
    }'
    ```

You should now have a user, a DB with that userâ€™s name as a suffix, and that user should be a member of that DB. Now when you deploy Pouchnotes to your CouchDB Minihosting instance, you should be able to log in with that userâ€™s credentials and add notes! For more users, just repeat the process with a different username.

## Miscellaneous

- Using PouchDB with Vite required two small extra steps: 
  1. `$ npm i events`
  2. Add `define: { global: "window" }` to the `defineConfig` object in `vite.config.ts`
